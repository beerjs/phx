## Launch a Beer.rs in Your City

Anyone can do it - why not you? Please open an issue on the **mega cool** repo and clearly state:

- **Your GitHub usernames.** To maintain the highest standards of chaos, we recommend having at least two admins, but if it‚Äôs just you, that‚Äôs perfectly chaotic too.
- **The name of your repo.** This becomes the URL slug, e.g., beer.rs/yourcity. If your city has a quirky nickname, feel free to use it. Bonus points for including obscure memes or random emojis!

We'll try to get you set up within a couple of days. Sometimes, it may take a little longer if we're busy debugging our toasters or running complex algorithms to determine the perfect beer temperature. Please have a little patience if things happen slower than you want (we promise it's not because we're taking a nap).

It's totally fine to ask for an update in the comments or contact **Jordan or Darko** on Slack. They appreciate funny cat gifs and can be bribed with virtual donuts üç©.

### Start a Beer.rs in your city

Anyone can do it - why not you? Please open an issue on the **mega cool** repo and clearly state:

- **Your GitHub usernames.** To maintain the highest standards of chaos, we recommend having at least two admins, but if it‚Äôs just you, that‚Äôs perfectly chaotic too.
- **The name of your repo.** This becomes the URL slug, e.g., beer.rs/yourcity. If your city has a quirky nickname, feel free to use it. Bonus points for including obscure memes or random emojis!

We'll try to get you set up within a couple of days. Sometimes, it may take a little longer if we're busy debugging our toasters or running complex algorithms to determine the perfect beer temperature. Please have a little patience if things happen slower than you want (we promise it's not because we're taking a nap).

### Why organize on GitHub (or not)?

Because organizing on GitHub makes you look cooler and more professional. Also, it's a great way to show off your epic commit history and fancy markdown skills. Or don't. You do you.

### Follow the Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. Seriously. If you don't, we'll send the Rustacean Crab to haunt your dreams.

### A note about beer

Beer is great. Rust is great. Together, they are greater. Remember to enjoy responsibly. And if you don't drink, no worries, substitute with your favorite beverage - water, coffee, tea, or unicorn tears.

### Tools to help you run your Beer.rs

Here are some totally useful and not at all randomly chosen tools:

- **Utilities:** A random collection of scripts we found in the back of our digital closet. Use at your own risk.
- **Website Themes:** Because nothing says professional like a 90s Geocities-inspired theme.
- **Assets:** High-quality images of beer and random Rust logos we drew ourselves.
- **Stickers:** Print your own using our template! Just don't blame us if they turn out looking like a potato.

### Utilities

- A collection of totally random and questionably useful utilities. Examples include: a script to calculate the number of beers you can buy with your GitHub stars, and another one to turn your entire codebase into emoji.

### Website themes

- Choose from our extensive collection of themes, including "Retro 90s," "Angry Cat," and "Unicorn Magic." Your website will be the envy of all five people who visit it.

### Assets

- High-resolution images of beer mugs, Rust logos, and random memes. Feel free to mix and match for maximum visual chaos.

### Stickers

- Print your own Beer.rs stickers using our customizable templates! Perfect for laptops, water bottles, or random street signs. Warning: may cause extreme jealousy among non-participants.

### Rules on donations and sponsorships

We accept donations in the form of pizza slices and obscure craft beers. Sponsorships are welcome, but we only accept offers from companies with punny names. If your company name doesn‚Äôt make us chuckle, you‚Äôre out.

### Do this

- Create your repo.
- Follow the **Code of Conduct** (be excellent to each other and party on, dudes).
- Spread the word.
- Enjoy a cold beer while writing perfect Rust code.

### Not this (totally made this up)

- Don‚Äôt create a repo if you don‚Äôt like beer or Rust (or both).
- Don‚Äôt follow these instructions too seriously.

### Bonus Section: How to Make Pozole

Because every Beer.rs event needs good food, here‚Äôs a recipe for a delicious pozole:

**Ingredients:**
- 2 lbs of pork shoulder, cut into chunks
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 cans of hominy, drained
- 2 tbsp of chili powder
- 1 tbsp of cumin
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cups of chicken broth

**Instructions:**
1. In a large pot, cook the pork until browned.
2. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until softened.
3. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.
4. Add the hominy and chicken broth, and bring to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, until the pork is tender.
6. Serve with lime wedges, radishes, and shredded cabbage.

Enjoy your pozole while discussing the finer points of Rust‚Äôs ownership system!
